## Questions:
1. What did you do this past week?
  
    This past week I prepared for the test. I started by going onto the python website and doing their tutorials. Then I went through all the code posted on the schedule, then the google doc, and then my notes that I take in lecture. I tried to implement every function that we used in class, which ended up being very helpful for the test.  I also thought making the cheatsheet was very helpful as well. It made me look up each function, which I was happy I did.
2. What's in your way?

    My goal this week is to do well on all the quizzes. I have a few bad grades that I need to replace when we go over 30 quizzes, so I need to do well this week. 
3. What will you do next week?

    This upcoming week our group will need to start the project. It is going to be hard to find a time when we can all meet since it is such a big group, but I'm sure we will figure something out.

## Tip
If you are graduation, buy your graduation gown. I went to buy my last week, but they said if you buy it the week of graduation, they may not have your size. (sorry my tip is so random, I couldn't think of much this week #posttestbrain)
