## Questions:
1. What did you do this past week?
    
    This past week, my group and I prepared for our presentation on Friday. We were all very excited after our presentation because we thought it went very well. I didn't know we were done with quizzes, so that was a surprise, but other than that last week was good. I didn't start studying as much as I would've liked. I am confused about decorators for sure, so if anyone wants to offer up some tutorials or something that helped them, that would be much appreciated.
2. What's in your way?

    THE TEST. Mainly decorators. Like I said above, I am a little confused about those. But I am going to try to go to office hours and meet with some friends this week so that I can become more familiar and feel better about them. 
3. What will you do next week? 

    This upcoming week I will study for the test. I have one big project due in another class on Wednesday, but hopefully my group and I can finish that early in the week (which probably won't happen). So I am going to try my best to study for this test in between working on my other project that is due in iOS.
  
## Class Experience
I'm really hoping I am able to prepare for the exam #2 as well as I did for exam #1. I am a little nervous that other things might get in the way, so I won't be able to prepare as much, but I'm hoping that I can.

## Tip
Study for Exam #2. It is this week, if you didn't know.
