## Past Week and Reaction to class
To be honest, I feel the first week back is always very overwhelming and hectic. I felt a little overwhelmed with all the assignments we have to do, but I think this happens to every students at the beginning of the semester. So in order to get organized, I went to the coop and bought my textbooks, added all the projects/assignments to my calendar, and set up the github for the blog posts. On Wednesday, we were presented with this extra credit opportunity. We can create a weekly blog discussing our experience in Software Engineering. On Friday, our first assignment was introduced. It is due in two weeks. 

I am very excited to be taking this class. Many past students have told me that I should not graduate without taking a Downing class. I was a little overwhelmed the first day about the number of projects and what not, but overall am very excited for this class. 


## What's in your way
As discussed above, I felt a little overwhelmed after the first week in this class. So actually sitting down and beginning the first Project is in my way. But I think once I get that started, I will feel much better about this class. I also need to brush up on my Python to be able to code in it again.

## Next Week
Next week, I am going to get started on the project. On Monday, I believe we are going to finish discussing the project in class. In the early part of the week, I want to get everything for the project set up. This ensures that by mid week I can really understand and start completing the project. I like to be able to complete projects earlier than later so that if I have questions, I can go into office hours.
