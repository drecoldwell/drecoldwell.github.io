## Questions:
1. What did you do this past week?
    
    This past week, I studied for my final test of the semester. It was a very stressful week, since I had a lot of assignments due, but happy to not have a final in this class. I started by going through the list of topics that Professor Downing had suggested. I spent a lot of time on MySQL, but I don't know if it really even helped on the test. I ended up reading the book about Refactoring and that really ended up helping in the end.
2. What's in your way?

    NOTHING. I am completely done with college. It feels great. Well I do need to search for an apartment, so that is standing in my way, but other than that, only the crappy weather on this Sunday really stopped me today.
3. What will you do next week? 

    This upcoming week I will sleep in, pack for Europe, lay in the sun, and do absolutely nothing. 
## Class Experience
Overall, I think I learned a lot about the front end of building a website. I learned a ton about AngularJS. I wished I had learned more about setting up the backend of a website but I guess that will just have to wait. I learned concepts about Python that I had never really taken the time to understand why it worked that way in a language. 

## Tip
Enjoy college, it flies by. Literally can still remember taking my Scott 314 final, like it was yesterday. Keep all your books from college (well the computer science ones). I wish I still had my 312 and 314 books.
