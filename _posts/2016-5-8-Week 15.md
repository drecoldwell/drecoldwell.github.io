## Questions:
1. What did you do this past week?
    
    This past week, I studied for my final test of the semester. It was a very stressful week, since i had a lot of assignments due, but happy to not have a final in this class.
2. What's in your way?

    NOTHING. I am completely done with college. It feels great.
3. What will you do next week? 

    This upcoming week I will sleep in, pack for Europe, lay in the sun, and do absolutely nothing. 
## Class Experience
Overall, I think I learned a lot about the front end of building a website. I learned a ton about AngularJS. I wished I had learned more about setting up the backend of a website but I guess that will just have to wait.

## Tip
Enjoy college, it flies by.
