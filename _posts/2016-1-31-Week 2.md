## Questions:
1. What did you do this past week?
This past week I was busy doing the readings for this class. I didn't realize how long the readings were going to be when I started them. I started Thursday after work, so that was not the smartest idea since they had to be read by Friday. I should've worked more on the first project but didn't get as much done as I would've liked.
2. What's in your way?
I had a few of my other classes in my way this week. I am taking an online class that has a ton of stuff due on Sunday nights. I am also in a 1 hour PHP class that is going to be time intensive for the first half of the semester. 
3. What will you do next week?
This upcoming week I am going to finish the project. It is due on Thursday, so really I have no choice but to do it. I am also going to try to get started on the assigned reading earlier than I did last week. That way I don't have to read 11 chapters in one night. I also want to better prepare for the quizzes. I think that is definitely going to be a challenge for this class. I also want to work on working on this project after work. When I come home from work on Tuesday and Thursday, I usually don't want to sit down and start coding again, but this week I am going to have to. 

## Tip
My tip of the week is to start the readings earlier. Reading 11 chapters in one night is not fun.
