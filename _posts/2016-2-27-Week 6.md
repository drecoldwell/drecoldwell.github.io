## Questions:
1. What did you do this past week?
  
    This past week was a little odd for me. On Monday, I missed class because I had a doctors appointment in Dallas and it lasted longer that it was supposed to. I was a little nervous about missing that class after I heard about what we learned, but luckily one of my friends, kindly brought me up to speed :) So I think my weird start to the week really threw me off. But I think I was able to learn what was taught in class Monday on my own.
2. What's in your way?

    Currently, I need to catch up on readings. I have been doing okay-ish on doing the readings. So this seems to be in my way, currently, because the test is coming up this upcoming week.
3. What will you do next week?

    This next week I am going to relax and do nothing. JUST KIDDING. I am going to study for the test. I didn't know we were allowed to bring a sheet into the exam, so I am going to go through the topics posted on Piazza by Professor Downing and start creating my sheet.

## Tip
I think I am going to be using Latex to create my cheat sheet. You can cram a lot of information on a page in latex. I use [ShareLatex](https://www.sharelatex.com/) to create my latex files.
