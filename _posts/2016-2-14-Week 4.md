## Questions:
1. What did you do this past week?

   This past week my partner and I started the project very early. I am very proud of how much we have actually accomplished so far. Now we are working on trying to get our prediction to 1.00, but it is currently at 1.41. 
  
2. What's in your way?

   Currently, we are struggling at finding an algorithm that predicts accurately within 1.00. We need to do a little more research on a better algorithm. I took the Info Retrieval and Web Search class at UT, in that class we studied recommenders. But because the cache cannot be too big, we at struggling to implement algorithms with the limited information we have :(

3. What will you do next week?

   This upcoming week my partner and I are going to finsih the project, seeing as it is due on Thursday. We would like to have it done by Wednesday, so that we don't have to be stressed on Thursday.

## Tip
So my roommate found a really cool [article](http://money.cnn.com/2016/02/12/technology/women-coders-study-github/index.html) 
that she sent me this week called *Women coders do better than men in gender-blind study*.
I recommend y'all read it, it is about a study that was done that looks at how
gender bias prevents female coders from being judged solely on their work. It is a very
interesting study!
